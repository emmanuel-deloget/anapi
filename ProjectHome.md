# What is anapi++? #

Anapi++ means "Android Native API for C++".

Anapi++ is a C++ interface for the Android Native Development Kit (NDK). Its goal is to help building native activities by wrapping the necessary functions into a convenient C++ library.

Anapi++ is written in C++11, meaning that you must compile it with a recent C++ compiler (the latest NDK ships with gcc 4.7; this compiler supports a large subset of the C++11 language).

Anapi++ is an Open Source product which is distributed under the terms of a zlib-like license (meaning you can incorporate it in any kind of product, including commercial products). The full text of this license
is to be found in docs/license.

# Is it Anapi++ or anapi++ #

Definitely the later. No upcase. Cleaner.
