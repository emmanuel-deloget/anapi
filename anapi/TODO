* implement on_configuration_changed() as an asynchronous event.

* implement on_save_instance_state() as a synchronous event.

* the ticker is awful. How can it be enhanced?

* the event dispatcher should be able to pick a message interpretor
  from a list instead of relying on a fixed set of interpretors. This
  list shall be modifiable from the outside - possibly from the app
  itself. 

* log should be rewritten. 

* both the app_activity and app_window are missing a lot of features.

* the app environment should be available to the app itself.
